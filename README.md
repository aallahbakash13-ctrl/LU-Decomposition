# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Start the program and import the required libraries, such as numpy or scipy.linalg.
2. Define or read the matrix for which the LU Decomposition needs to be performed.
3. Use the LU decomposition function (such as scipy.linalg.lu()) to obtain
the Lower triangular matrix (L), Upper triangular matrix (U), and permutation matrix P.
4. Print the matrices L, U, and P

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
